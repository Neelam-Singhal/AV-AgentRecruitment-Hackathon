    "## Smart Agent Recruitment Challenge\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "FinMan is a Financial Distribution company. Over the last 10 years, they have created an offline distribution channel across India. They sell Financial products to consumers by hiring agents in their network. These agents are freelancers and get commission when they make a product sale.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Overview of FinMan On-boarding process\r\n",
    "The Managers at FinMan are primarily responsible for recruiting agents. Once a manager has identified a potential applicant, the would explain the business opportunity to the agent. Once the agent provides the consent, an application is made to FinMan to become an agent. This date is known as application_receipt_date.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the next 3 months, this potential agent has to undergo a 7 day training at the FinMan branch (about Sales processes and various products) and clear a subsequent examination in order to become a FinMan agent.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## The problem - Who are the best agents?\r\n",
    " As is obvious in the above process, there is a significant investment which FinMan makes in identifying, training and recruiting these agents. However, there are a set of agents who do not bring in the expected resultant business.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " Finman has approached you and asked you to to predict the target variable for each potential agent, which would help them identify the right agents to hire.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Evaluation\r\n",
    "Your model's performance would be evaluated based on roc_auc score.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Public and Private Split\r\n",
    "Test Data is further divided into Public and Private set.\r\n",
    "Public leaderboard is based on First 2 months of the test dataset (02-Jul-2008 and 01-Sep-2008) and rest of test dataset is used for Private leaderboard.\r\n"
